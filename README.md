# Project-8-Backtesting
In this project, you will build a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and you'll implement it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. You'll also use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of your portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL). You will have the option to modify and customize the backtest as well.
